            <p>To My Dearest Frances,</p>
            <p>
              How many years has it been since I started chasing you? Longing for you? I would catch glimpses of you across the street, the library, and on the 6th floor of the NGE building—in the places where I exist. I have run, hoping to reach you, through the weight of the crowd, but never within reach.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have followed you here in Cebu thinking that maybe, after everything that I’ve done, you would let me hold you. That for once, you would stop running and turn to face me. But you remain elusive, ignoring my plea, passing through me and leaving only the ghost of your presence behind.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have ruined myself just to become deserving of you. But sometimes there are whispers in the quiet—that I don’t deserve you. That maybe… I deserve something more than you.
            </p>
